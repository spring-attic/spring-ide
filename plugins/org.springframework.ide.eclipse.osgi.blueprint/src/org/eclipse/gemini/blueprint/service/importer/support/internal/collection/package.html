Gemini Blueprint service collections.
<br>
This package provides dynamic collections which allow iterating while
the underlying content is being modified. These collections are best
used through iterators. In fact, the implementation provide
<strong>consistent</strong>
iterators: it is guaranteed that {@link Iterator#next()} will obey the
result of the previously called {@link Iterator#hasNext()} even though
the collection content has been modified.
<p />The end-user implementations are thread-safe.
<p />Note that these collections are not meant to be generic or for
usage outside the framework - they are adapters for the OSGi
environment.
