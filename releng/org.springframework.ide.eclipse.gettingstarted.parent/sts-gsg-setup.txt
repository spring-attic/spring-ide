Setting Up STS - GSG integration
================================

Note: the format of the web page in the new dashboard is very much
in flux, changing all the time. We know at the moment it looks a bit crappy.

1. Download and install STS 3.3.0.RELEASE from
   http://www.springsource.org/downloads/sts-ggts
   
2. Temporary: Edit STS.ini and add (at end):

-Dgithub.user.name=XXXXXXX
-Dgithub.user.password=XXXXXXX

Use a username and password for a github user that
is a *member* of *springsource.meta* org.

3. Install New Dashboard from update site:

http://dist.springframework.org/snapshot/GSG_INTEGRATION/nightly/

Install everything under 'Spring Getting Started Integration'.

4. Restart STS
5. Close and reopen Dashboard (if the old dashboard is still open).

Notes:
 - New Dahsboard URLs can be configured via 
 Window >> Preferences >> SpringSource >> Dashboard (New)
 - Browsing GSG content in the dashboard an extra link should
   appear underneath the 'Donwload Zip' button.
   Click the button should open a Wizard to import GSG content
   with the correct guide preselected.
 - If clicking link does not open the wizard. It means the
   particular content was not found. The most likely cause of
   this is incorrect github credentials. 
   Another cause may be the sagan pages are out of synch and
   displaying conten that can't be discovered on github 
   springsource.meta org.
 - 'Import' links only appear in Dashboard not the standard
   Eclipse 'Internal Web Browser'.
 - github credentials will not be needed anymore when the
   springsource.meta project become publically accessible.

Linux Users only
================

On some linux platforms there are issues using the Eclipse 
embedded webbrowser widget. The problems are caused by
native libraries that are either not installed or the
wrong version in your particular flavor/install of Linux.

Symptoms include 
  - Blank Welcome page
  - New Dahsboard not working
  - JVM Crashes (when using internal web browser)
  
To rememedy do the following:
  - Download XULRunner 10.0.2 (http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/10.0.2/runtimes/) and unpack
  - Add the following arguments to STS.ini

-Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=<path-to-unpack-location>/xulrunner-10.0.2
-Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.DefaultType=mozilla

Downloading xulrunner and setting XULRunnerPath may not be necessary on all flavors of
Linux. It may be sufficient just to set browser.DefaultType.
However downloading and setting XULRunner path is a surefire way of ensuring a Eclipse compatible
XULRunner.
