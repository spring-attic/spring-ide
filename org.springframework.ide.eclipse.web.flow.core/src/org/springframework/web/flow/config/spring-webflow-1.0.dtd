	Spring Web Flow 1.0 DTD
	Authors: Keith Donald, Erwin Vervaet
	
	This DTD defines the Spring Web Flow (SWF) XML syntax.
	
	The root "flow" element of this document defines exactly one Flow definition.
    A Flow definition is a blueprint for an executable, single-user process
	(or conversation).
	
	A flow is composed of one or more states that form the steps of the flow.
	Each state executes behavior when entered. What behavior is executed is a
	function of the state's type. Core state types include view states,
	action states, subflow states, decision states, and end states.
    
    Each flow definition must specify exactly one start state.
    Events that occur in transitionable states drive state transitions.
    
	XML documents that conform to this DTD should declare the following doctype:

	<!DOCTYPE flow PUBLIC "-//SPRING//DTD WEBFLOW 1.0//EN"
		"http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-webflow-1.0.dtd">
-->

<!--
	Defines exactly one flow definition.
	
	A flow is composed of one or more states that define the steps of the flow.
	It may be annotated with attributes that define custom characteristics that
	can be used to affect flow execution.
	
	A flow may also be configured to respond to exceptions thrown by its states.
	
	It may import one or more local bean definition files defining custom
	flow artifacts (such as actions, exception handlers, view selectors,
	transition criteria, etc).
	
	Finally, a flow may nest one or more other flows within this document to
	use as subflows, referred to as 'inline flows'.

	The action referenced by this element must implement the org.springframework.webflow.Action

	a POJO that does not implement this interface, the method on the POJO referenced by the

<!--
	An optional name qualifier for this action. When specified this action will
	qualify execution result event ids by this name. For example, if this action is
	named "placeOrder" and signals a "success" result event after execution, the
	fully qualified result event the flow can respond to would be "placeOrder.success".
	
	An action with a name is often referred to as a "named action".
-->
<!ATTLIST action name CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	The name of the target method to invoke to execute this action.  The value
	of this attribute is a method binding expression that evaluates to a method 
	on the referenced action bean.
	
	If this action bean extends org.springframework.webflow.action.MultiAction,
	the expression is simply a static method name.

    For example:
        <action bean="formAction" method="setupForm"/>
    
    The actual signature of this method must be of the form:
	    public Event <method>(RequestContext) throws Exception { ... }
	    
	If this action is an abritrary bean (POJO), the expression can 
	match any public method on the bean's implementation. In this case the
	expression format is as follows: <method>(${arg 1}, ..., ${arg n}) where any 
	${arg n} expressions are evaluated against the flow execution
	org.springframework.webflow.RequestContext.

	For example:
        <action bean="orderClerk" method="placeOrder(${flowScope.order})"/>
-->
<!ATTLIST action method CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
	The name of the attribute that will expose the return value of the target action method.
	Used in conjunction with the 'method' and 'resultScope' attributes.
	Only directly applicable when this action invokes a method on a bean (POJO)
	that returns a value.

	For example:
        <action bean="orderClerk" method="placeOrder(${flowScope.order})" resultName="orderConfirmation"/>
        
    ... exposes the 'placeOrder(Order)' method return value in request scope

	The scope of the attribute that will expose the return value of the target action method.
	Used in conjunction with the 'resultName' attribute, and only directly applicable

	For example:
        <action bean="bookingAgent" method="suggestItineraries(${flowScope.trip})" resultName="itineraries" resultScope="flow"/>

    ... exposes the 'suggestItineraries(Trip)' method return value in flow scope 
    under the attribute name 'itineraries'.

	The most basic value is a static event id. For example:
  	    <transition on="submit" to="state"/>
	
	Sophisticated transitional expressions are also supported. For example:
	    <transition on="${#result == 'submit' && flowScope.attribute == 'foo'}" to="state"/>
	
	Custom transition criteria implementations can be referenced by id. For example:
	    <transition on="bean:myCustomCriteria" to="state"/>
	    
	The exact interpretation of this attribute value depends on the TextToTransitionCriteria
	converter that is installed.

<!--
	Defines a view state, a state where a view will be selected for rendering, the 
	executing flow will be 'paused', and control will be returned to the user.
	A view state allows the user to participate in the flow.

	A view state is a transitionable state. A view state transition is triggered by a
	user input event.

	This value may be a logical application view name or even a direct pointer to a view template.
	For example:
	    "priceForm" or "/WEB-INF/jsp/priceForm.jsp"
	
	This value may also be qualified with a prefix to denote a specific (possibly custom)
	ViewSelector strategy.

	Use of the "redirect:" prefix indicates this view state should trigger a redirect to a 
	well-known "conversation URL".  This causes the selected application view to be cached
	and a redirect request is issued that refers back to it at a specific URL.  This allows
	for bookmarking and refreshing the last view selection made.
		"redirect:priceForm"

	Use of the "externalRedirect:" prefix indicates this view state should trigger a 
	redirect to an absolute external URL, typically to interface with an external system.
	External redirect query parameters may be specified using ${expressions} that evaluate
	against the request context. For example:
	    "externalRedirect:/someOtherSystem.htm?orderId=${flowScope.order.id}"
	
	Use of the "bean:" prefix references a custom ViewSelector implementation you define,
	exposed by id in either a flow-local context using the "import" element or in the parent 
	context.
	    "bean:myCustomViewSelector"
	
	The exact semantics regarding the interpretation of this value are determined by the
	installed TextToViewSelector converter.

	Note when no view name is provided, this view state will make a "null" view selection. A null
	view does not request the rendering of a view, it only pauses the flow and returns control 
	the client. Use a null view when another state is expected to generate the response.

<!ELEMENT exit-actions ( action+ )>

<!--
	Defines a decision state, a state that evaluates one or more expressions or method 
	return values to decide which state to enter next.  Intended to be used purely as an
	idempotent 'navigation' or 'routing' state and is not intended to execute non-idempotent
	(or mutating) behavior.
	
	A decision state is a transitionable state. A decision state transition can be triggered 
	in two possible ways:
	
	1. By evaluating a boolean expression against the flow execution request context.  To 
	define expressions, use the 'if' or 'transition' elements.
	
	2. By evaluating the result of a single action invoked when this state is entered. 
	To define an action, use the 'action' element.  The referenced action bean may implement 
	the Action interface or may be a method on a JavaBean (POJO) that returns a value.
	In the latter case, a string-form of the method return value will be used as
	the criteria for a state transition.
	
	Examples:

	A simple boolean expression test, using the convenient 'if' element:
	
	    <decision-state id="requiresShipping">
		    <if test="${flowScope.sale.shipping}" then="enterShippingDetails" else="processSale"/>
    	</decision-state>

	The same boolean expression test, using the 'transition' element as an alternative:
		
        <decision-state id="requiresShipping">
            <transition on="${flowScope.sale.shipping}" then="enterShippingDetails"/>
            <transition on="${!flowScope.saleShipping}" then="processSale"/>
        </decision-state>

	Use of the 'action' element to invoke a method that returns a boolean, combined with use of
	transition elements to evaluate the string-form of the boolean result:
	
        <decision-state id="requiresShipping">
		    <action bean="shippingService" method="isShippingRequired"/>
    	    <transition on="yes" to="enterShippingDetails"/>
     	    <transition on="no" to="processSale"/>
        </decision-state>	

	Use of the 'action' element to invoke a method that returns a value object, combined with
	use of transition elements to evaluate the string-form of the result:
	
        <decision-state id="handleShippingMethod">
            <action bean="shippingService" method="getShippingMethod(${flowScope.sale})"/>
            <transition on="Normal" to="enterNormalShipping"/>
            <transition on="Priority" to="enterPriorityShipping"/>
        </decision-state>
	
	Do not combine use of the 'if' element with use of the 'transition' element or 'action' 
	element.  Use one strategy or the other.

	subflow result event, which describes the logical subflow outcome that occurred.  Typically the 
	criteria for this transition is the id of the subflow end state that was entered.
	
	While the subflow is active, this flow is suspended waiting for the subflow to complete execution.
	When the subflow completes execution by reaching an end state, this state is expected
