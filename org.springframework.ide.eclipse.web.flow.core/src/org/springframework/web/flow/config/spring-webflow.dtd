	Spring Web Flow DTD
	Authors: Erwin Vervaet, Keith Donald
	
	This DTD defines the web flow XML syntax. Web flows capture the page flow
	in (part of) a web application.

	XML documents that conform to this DTD should declare the following doctype:

	<!DOCTYPE webflow PUBLIC "-//SPRING//DTD WEBFLOW//EN"
		"http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-webflow.dtd">
-->
